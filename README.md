# EDDS-Stuttgart-MSFS
Addon airport for the missing EDDS-Stuttgart for MSFS

This is still VERY basic. There is no real hangar yet (only whats there already in standard), no gates, no markings. Only 2 taxiways on both ends are in, and the runway of course.
You can choose it in the sim, start from one of the (few) parkings ive implemented or directly from the runway. 
ILS info and approaches are missing as well.

I basically made tis for myself to be able to fly from here but why not share it with anyone who wants the same?

PLEASE, dont write about bugs or improvments, they will come.

Next things to come soon:

v 0.2
- Cargo apron
- Gates
- Hangars

v 0.3
- details and clutter

v 0.4
- bugfixes

...

v 1.0 handcrafted objects and buildings
